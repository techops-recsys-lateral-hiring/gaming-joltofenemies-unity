# Introducing Jolt Of Enemies

**Jolt of Enemies** is an Arcade 2D Space Shooter that is part of a new internal initiative.

You have been placed into the development team, whose current goal is to build a game prototype.

Unfortunately, two members of the team are on annual leave, and another one has called in sick! You are left with another Thoughtworker to progress with the current game design document. This is your chance to make an impact on the business, improve the code base and deliver value.

## Requirements

The project requires [Unity 2022 LTS](https://unity.com/download) or higher. This project was developed using Unity 2022.3. The specific version can be found at /ProjectSettings/ProjectVersion.txt

### Multimedia

The project uses a free asset package from Kenney, [Space Shooter Redux](https://www.kenney.nl/assets/space-shooter-redux), licensed under Creative Commons.

### C#

C# support is out-of-box. You can use the editor of your choice.
You can create *.cs files and new directories, if needed.

The project is using the old Input System. If you wish to use the New Input System, please set it up *before* the interview takes place.

### Game Design Document

This document will be shown to you when meeting your pair, so you can both decide how to progress.
